## Recomendations 

Even though Facet Wealth is doing good business wise. I beleive they could use an application. If Facet Wealth develops an app, it is certain they will have the capability to broaden their horizon and get new clients of a more diversed background and age group. An app which enables customers to have the ability of chatting directly with their attributed CFP and even following up on their financial progress will boost the company's employee-clientele engagement thereby inccreasing their customer satisfaction rate. It is an appropriate solution because it will conquer their clientele needs of hyper-personalization and counter the growth of chatbots. The application will use technologies such as augmented reality to enhance and enrich services for clients and quantum computing for their backend computing as it increases the speed for financial transactions.
